You know that each mega-artist in pop, country, and hip-hop will be hitting that magenta carpet excited about going home with a win. Which stars will we talk to? We can't know â€” any more than we know that Cher is receiving an Icon Award. (Well, we actually do know that). But we won't know what she's wearing until we see her on that carpet. That's a big must-see.",
