This bug had the potential to expose the email address and phone number associated with a Vine account to third parties under certain circumstances.",

    "In our investigation, we discovered that the email address and phone number linked to your account were exposed.  We want to emphasize that this information can't directly be used to access your account, and we have no information indicating that it has been misused.  We take these incidents very seriously, and we're sorry this occurred.",

    "As a security best practice, we recommend that you be cautious if you receive emails or text messages from unknown senders.  Please keep in mind that Vine will only send you communications from support@twitter.com, and we will never send emails with attachments or request your password by email." ,
