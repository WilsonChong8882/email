{{_i}}Update to our Privacy Policy{{/i}}

=

{{_i}}We’re updating our <a href="{{_tl1}}https://twitter.com/privacy{{/tl1}}" class="blue">Privacy Policy</a> to reflect improvements we’ve made to Twitter.{{/i}} {{_i}}We encourage you to read the updated policy in full — by using our services on or after June 18, 2017, you’ll be agreeing to these revisions.{{/i}} {{_i}}Here are some of the important updates:{{/i}}

{{_i}}<strong>Transparency and control:</strong> We’ve launched new <a href="{{_tl2}}https://twitter.com/personalization{{/tl2}}" class="blue">Personalization and Data settings</a> and expanded <a href="{{_tl3}}https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data{{/tl3}}" class="blue">Your Twitter Data</a> to give you more transparent access to your information and more granular controls over how your data is used by Twitter.{{/i}} {{_i}}These enhanced settings will replace Twitter’s reliance on the Do Not Track browser setting, which we will no longer support.{{/i}}

{{_i}}<strong>Web data:</strong> We’ve updated how we store and use data from other websites that integrate Twitter content like embedded timelines, to improve our services and personalize the content we show you including ads.{{/i}} {{_i}}We do not store web page visit data for users who are in the European Union and EFTA States.{{/i}}

{{_i}}<strong>Data sharing:</strong> We’ve updated how we share non-personal, aggregated, and device-level data, including under select partnership agreements that allow the data to be linked to your name, email, or other personal information if you give the partner your consent.{{/i}} {{_i}}You can control whether your data is shared under these partnership agreements in your <a href="{{_tl4}}https://twitter.com/personalization{{/tl4}}" class="blue">Personalization and Data settings</a>.{{/i}}

{{_i}}<strong>Personalization across your devices:</strong> We’ve explained how we use data to personalize across your devices, and given you additional control in your <a href="{{_tl5}}https://twitter.com/personalization{{/tl5}}" class="blue">Personalization and Data settings</a> for devices that you haven’t used to log into Twitter.{{/i}}

{{_i}}<strong>Privacy Shield and the Digital Advertising Alliance:</strong> We’re excited to announce that we will be participating in the Swiss-US Privacy Shield program and adhering to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.{{/i}}

{{_i}}We hope you see value in these changes as we continue to improve your Twitter experience in a way that dovetails with our heartbeat as a company — a commitment to protecting and defending your privacy.{{/i}} {{_i}}If you have any questions, feel free to write to us <a href="{{_tl1}}https://support.twitter.com/forms/privacy{{/tl1}}" class="blue">here</a>.{{/i}} {{_i}}Thank you for using Twitter!{{/i}}
