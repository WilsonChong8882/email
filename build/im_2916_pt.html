{{_i}}Hi @{{screen_name}},{{/i}}

{{_i}}When you set a password for your Twitter account, we use technology that masks it so no one at the company can see it.{{/i}} {{_i}}We recently identified a bug that stored passwords unmasked in an internal log.{{/i}} {{_i}}We have fixed the bug, and our investigation shows no indication of breach or misuse by anyone.{{/i}}

{{_i}}Out of an abundance of caution, we ask that you consider changing your password on all services where youâ€™ve used this password.{{/i}} {{_i}}You can change your Twitter password anytime by going to the password <a href="{{_tl1}}https://mobile.twitter.com/settings/password/./{{/tl1}}" class="blue">settings</a> page.{{/i}} 

{{_i}}About The Bug{{/i}} 

{{_i}}We mask passwords through a process called hashing using a function known as bcrypt, which replaces the actual password with a random set of numbers and letters that are stored in Twitter's system.{{/i}} {{_i}}This is an industry standard.{{/i}} 

{{_i}}Due to a bug, passwords were written to an internal log before completing the hashing process.{{/i}} {{_i}}We found this error ourselves, removed the passwords, and are implementing plans to prevent this bug from happening again.{{/i}} 

{{_i}}Tips on Account Security{{/i}} 

{{_i}}1.{{/i}} {{_i}}Again, although we have no reason to believe password information ever left Twitter's systems or was misused by anyone, there are a few steps you can take to help us keep your account safe:{{/i}} 

{{_i}}2.{{/i}} {{_i}}Change your password on Twitter and on any other service where you may have used the same password.{{/i}} 

{{_i}}3.{{/i}} {{_i}}Use a strong password that you don't reuse on other services.{{/i}} {{_i}}Enable <a href="{{_tl2}}https://t.co/login-verification{{/tl2}}" class="blue">login verification</a>, also known as two factor authentication.{{/i}} 

{{_i}}4.{{/i}} {{_i}}This is the single best action you can take to increase your account security.{{/i}} {{_i}}Use a password manager to make sure you're using strong, unique passwords everywhere.{{/i}} 

{{_i}}We are very sorry this happened.{{/i}} {{_i}}We recognize and appreciate the trust you place in us, and are committed to earning that trust every day.{{/i}}
