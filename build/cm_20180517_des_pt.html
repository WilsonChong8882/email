{{_i}}Hi @{{screen_name}},{{/i}}

{{_i}}We'd like to notify you of some important changes to the Twitter API platform that are coming up and help you understand what it means.{{/i}}

{{_i}}We have postponed the retirement date of Site Streams, User Streams, and legacy Direct Message endpoints, giving developers more time to use the Account Activity API and complete their migration. These services and endpoints will now be deprecated on Thursday, August 16, 2018.{{/i}}
> https://developer.twitter.com/apply

{{_i}}Last April we announced many changes coming to our platform including replacing existing endpoints with improved versions. We've been steadily launching new APIs and on December 19th we announced that we would be deprecating a few services after six months. Developers using Site Streams, User Streams and legacy Direct Message endpoints have three additional months for migration, beyond the original retirement date of June 19th 2018. These services and endpoints will now be shut down on Thursday August 16, 2018.{{/i}}
