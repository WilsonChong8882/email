{{_i}}Players are gonna play. And play. And play. And when you're not playing, you might want to do some watching. Why? Because the world's best CS:GO gamers are coming to Oakland for the next stop on the Intel Extreme Masters series. Follow the battles as they happen. Take part in the conversations in real time. Then down an energy drink or two and stream some more.{{/i}}
