{{#i}}Thanks for your dedication, and all your contributions to Twitter's Translation center. You're one of the reasons Twitter is available so many different languages. If you've noticed that your Translator badge is not featured in your profile, it's because the badge is only awarded to people who maintain a certain level of participation. But don’t worry! If you come back to the Translation Center and start again to vote and submit high quality translations that will get approved, you’ll have the chance to regain your badge!{{/i}}

{{#i}}Have questions about specific strings or want to learn more from other language translators? Visit your language's <a href="{{#tl2}}https://translate.twitter.com/forum{{/tl2}}" class="link">forum</a> for answers.{{/i}}
