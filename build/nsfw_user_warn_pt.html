{{/trigger_tweet_item}}{{#i}}Upon review, we have determined that the media is potentially sensitive and have labeled it accordingly.{{/i}} {{#i}}There will now be a click-through warning message over the media for users whose accounts are set so they are informed before viewing media that may be sensitive.{{/i}} {{#i}}See the <a href="{{twitter_rules_url}}">Twitter Rules</a> and the <a href="{{policy_article_url_no_redirect}}">Twitter media policy</a> for more information.{{/i}}

{{#i}}We have also updated your <a href="{{media_settings_url_no_redirect}}">Content</a> settings to reflect that media you Tweet may contain sensitive material so that users can be informed prior to viewing it.{{/i}} {{#i}}If you regularly Tweet media that may be considered sensitive, we recommend keeping this setting update in place.{{/i}} {{#i}}If you would like to change the setting, visit your <a href="{{media_settings_url_no_redirect}}">Content</a> settings to uncheck the box next to â€œMark media I tweet as containing material that may be sensitive".{{/i}} {{#i}}Note that changing your setting will not remove the warning message from this media, or any other media Tweeted while this setting was active.{{/i}}
